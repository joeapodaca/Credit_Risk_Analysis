# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes


## Results
Reviews from both Vine reviewers and non-Vine reviewers were analyzed to see what percentage of reviewers are leaving 5-star reviews.
